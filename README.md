# Nando D'Oria Portfolio
This is the working and personal porfolio site for designer and developer, Nando DOria.

[Visit the live site](http://nandodoria.ca/)


## Built with
* [Zurb Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) - Foundation Framework

## Authors
* **Fernando D'Oria**(https://github.com/nandodoria) -

### Installing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nandodoria/Doria_F_Portfolio
```

Open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd Doria_F_Portfolio
npm install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass compiler. The site will not show properly unless these steps are followed. In development mode, the portfolio needs to be run on a live server (MAMP/WAMP) in order for the database and json to work.
